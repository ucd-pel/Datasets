This repository contains datasets used in the research activities of Vanessa Ayala-Rivera during her work at the **Performance Engineering Laboratory** at the [School of Computer Science and Informatics (University College Dublin)](http://www.csi.ucd.ie).

Datasets
----------------------
This repository contains the following datasets:

### 1. [Irish Census Datasets] (https://github.com/vayalar/Datasets/tree/master/IrishCensus) ###

These datasets correspond to tabular data containing records with social, economic and demographic data which mimics the distribution of aggregated statistics from the 2011 Irish Census data. More details about the values of each attribute and methodology followed to generate this dataset can be found in the technical report available at: (https://www.csi.ucd.ie/content/synthetic-data-generation-using-benerator-tool)

### 2. [Insurance Datasets](https://github.com/vayalar/Datasets/tree/master/Insurance) ###

These datasets correspond to tabular data containing records with social and demographic information from individuals. This information coresponds to attributes such as their age, occupation, workplace, favorite recreational activity and places where this is practiced. Moreover, this datasets contain two classification attributes (risk of accident and salary class).
